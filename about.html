      <p>Whether you want to create a top 10 list of your favourite novels or rate some video games, Media Masterlist has you covered. You can fill out the table, add or delete rows, edit column titles, save your progress, and export the table as a spreadsheet. This project was created for Module 1 of Get Coding, and would not have been possible without the amazing mentorship of Jillian Breau. Her support was essential to the website's development.

        <h3><strong>How do I use this?</strong></h3>
        <p>This project was designed with customization in mind, so you can use it however you’d like! If you want to rate some video games, check out my personal <a class="light-link" href="https://danielledonnelly.github.io/my-media-list/">top 10 list</a> for an example of how the table looks when filled with information. If you’d prefer to rate some books or songs, try renaming a few of the columns before filling them in. You may want to change the “platform” and “status” headers depending on what you’re listing – you could opt to use those columns to track authors and page counts if you’re listing books, or musicians and album names if you’re listing songs.</p>

        <h3><strong>What inspired you to make this project?</strong></h3>
        <p>Media Masterlist was inspired by two of my passions: media, and (you guessed it!) masterlists. I’ve spent many years using spreadsheets to document my favourite video games, movies, and books. There are plenty of websites out there that let you rank specific types of media – Letterboxd is a popular film rating platform, for example – but I wanted to create a platform that could be used to rank anything: video games, board games, music, podcasts, TV shows, movies, and more!

        <h3><strong>What’s your background?</strong></h3>
        <p>I work as a marketing specialist with a fantastic local credit union, and I’m currently enrolled in Get Coding. As a lifelong learner, I’m always looking to refine my skills and become as well-rounded as possible. I aspire to be the type of marketer who can do it all: write compelling copy for a website, design a stellar user experience, and then bring it all to life via code. Get Coding has been crucial to my progress towards this goal.</p>
